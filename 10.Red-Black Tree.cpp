        Fixing deletions in a red-black tree is a critical process to maintain the tree's balanced properties after a node removal.

        When a node is deleted, it can potentially violate the red-black tree properties,
         such as maintaining equal black height in all paths from the root to the leaves and ensuring no two consecutive red nodes appear.
          The fix deletion process starts by identifying the type of node being removedâ€”either a leaf node or an internal node with one or two children.
           If the node is black, its removal could disrupt the black height,
            leading to an imbalance. The process involves a series of steps,
             including node recoloring and tree rotations, to restore the balance.
              These operations ensure that every path from the root to the leaves retains the same number of black nodes and the red-black tree properties are upheld.
               The process continues up the tree, checking and correcting any violations until the entire tree maintains its balanced state,
                ensuring efficient performance for future operations.

        When a node is removed, it can potentially violate the red-black properties,
         such as maintaining equal black height in all paths from the root to the leaves and ensuring no two consecutive red nodes appear.
          The deletion process begins with a standard binary search tree deletion,

            After removal, if the deleted node or the node that replaced it is black, this can cause a violation of the red-black properties.
             To fix this, the tree undergoes a series of adjustments, which may involve recoloring nodes and performing rotations to ensure the properties are preserved.
              These steps include cases like when the sibling of the deleted node is red, or when the sibling is black and has black children, among others.
               The goal is to restore the tree's balance while ensuring that the red-black properties are maintained,
                which is crucial for the tree to provide efficient performance for subsequent operations.
